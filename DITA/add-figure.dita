  <title>Add a figure123</title>
  <shortdesc>A figure is a container part that usually holds a graphic and a title.</shortdesc>

      <p>If you need to include some specific information about a graphic, such as a caption
                or a description, you can add a figure. The graphic is optional, so you can also add
                a figure simply to group a small amount of content together under a title. For
                example, you may want to add a title above an example of code block. </p>
